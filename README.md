#Fast Food Guru

Fast Food Guru is a full stack app that allows users to search for individual fast food locations and leave a review and see all users reviews for individual resturant.

The tech stack is React and Redux on the front end with Express, MongoDB and Mongoose with Token authentication implemented through JWT and Passport.js.

**To get started**

1. clone the repo
1. run npm install
1. switch into the client directory and run "npm run start"
1. switch into the api directory and run "nodemon index.js"

_You do need to have mongodb installed on your machine and be able to run a local mongodb database on your machine in order to work with the database. I have not hosted the database yet._

<hr>

Though my project is still under construction, I have implemented:

- Token authentication
- Express routes for user registration and log in
- Landing page with register and sign in and sign up capacity
- Redux has been implemented and user information is passed into the redux store upon successful login or registration

Until I host this project, please see below
